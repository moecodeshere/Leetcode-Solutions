## 🔍 Why this Repository?

This repo is not just a solution bank. It's a personal roadmap to:
- ✅ Practic by **problem-solving patterns**, not just topics.
- ✅ Improve **code quality** and **Java syntax fluency**.
- ✅ Develop true **algorithmic thinking** and systemized approaches.
- ✅ Make revision faster with clean explanations and categorizations.

## 🧠 Core Problem-Solving Patterns

| 🧩 Pattern            | 💡 When to Use                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Two Pointers         | When scanning from both ends or moving inwards      |
| Sliding Window       | Substrings, subarrays, longest/repeating patterns   |
| Prefix Sum / Diff    | Range-based queries, cumulative totals              |
| Stack / Monotonic    | Previous/next greater elements, parsing expressions |
| Backtracking         | Permutations, combinations, constraint-based paths  |
| Binary Search        | Sorted input, finding boundaries, search space      |
| Dynamic Programming  | Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure    |
| Union Find / DSU     | Disjoint components, connectivity problems          |

## 🧰 Data Structures Mastered Here.

| Structure        | Use Cases & Application Areas                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Arrays           | Sorting, partitioning, searching, prefix-based logic |
| HashMaps / Sets  | Fast lookups, frequency counts, uniqueness checks    |
| Stacks / Queues  | Parsing, order retention, monotonic sequences        |
| Linked Lists     | Pointer manipulation, reversal, merging              |
| Trees            | DFS, BFS, recursion, tree building                   |
| Graphs           | Topo sort, shortest path, DFS/BFS traversals         |
| Heaps / PriorityQ| Top K problems, streaming data, merging sorted lists |
| Tries            | Prefix-based searching, autocomplete systems         |
| 1D/2D DP Arrays  | Grid problems, subset sums, palindromes              |

## 🧭 Learning Objectives

This repo is optimized for:

📘 **Learning Efficiency**  
- Each problem is tied to a common pattern and includes annotated code  
- Java-specific syntax tricks and best practices explained

🧠 **Depth Over Breadth**  
- Instead of covering 1000 problems, we focus on the ones that **build intuition**  
- Strategic repetition of concepts in varying problem forms

💼 **Interview Readiness**  
- Emphasis on what companies ask most
- Strong focus on patterns like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion, and DP

## 📚 Study Methodology

Each uploaded solution follows this format:

1. 🔖 **Problem Tag**: e.g., Arrays, HashMap, Greedy, etc.
2. 🧠 **Approach Summary**: What’s the strategy and why it works
3. 🕒 **Time & Space Complexity**: Always stated for clarity
4. ✅ **Java Code**: Clean, readable, and commented
5. 🧩 **Pattern Mapped**: So you can link it to similar questions
